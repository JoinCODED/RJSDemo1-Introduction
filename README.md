# RJSDemo1 - Introduction

1. Run through the installation from warehouse (students should follow along):

   - [Babel Syntax Highlighting](https://warehouse.joincoded.com/workshop/react-1-introduction/setup/babel-syntax-highlighting/)

2. Create a react add `yarn create react-app`

3. Run the application - show it in the browser - show the react dev tools

4. Show that `public/index.html` is _empty_

5. Show `src/index.js`:

   - Show the imports - React, css, App,
   - Show the `render` - explain that it **injects** the contents of `App` into `div.root`  
     We'll explain what `App` is later.

6. Show `src/App.js` - show the "HTML" - we'll explain what this is soon.

7. Open browser and code side by side! Change something! IT RELOADS BY ITSELF! GO NUTS!
